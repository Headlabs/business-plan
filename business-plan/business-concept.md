## Business Concept

We plan to starting a software development company that builds consumer and enterprise applications specifically for use in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). In addition to product design and software development, we will offer QA testing to a variety of clients for existing applications. Our business is unique, because we have a long history of software development and design and will use this experience to help others navigate this new technology. 

We will design, create and foster memorable experiences for end users, while Ã¥becoming a market leader in the VR and AR space.
