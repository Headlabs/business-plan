## Products and Services
[Our list of product ideas](https://github.com/Headlabs/product-ideas) are iterative, and is growing. We will start our first service offering with QA Testing of VR applications.

### Main Service Offerings Starting Out
** Sell blocks of hours for product development advice to entrepeneurs.
** A UI/UX testing service for VR developers to receive feedback on applications they are building.

### Competitive Advantages
Our competive advantage is that we have backgrounds in software development and user experience. While the VR space is new, our technical knowledge and backgrounds help us in deciphering and explaining issues that potential software companies may be running into with their VR applications.

In addition, having an understanding in heuristics, ergonomics, photography and user experience best practices help us to make well thought out and intentional recommendations to our customers; who will in turn make better software.
